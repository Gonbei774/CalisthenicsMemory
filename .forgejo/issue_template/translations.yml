        (Trial) You may write this issue in your native language.
        For issues in languages other than English, I will respond primarily in Japanese.

        If you can provide a full native-speaker translation, you can add it directly on Weblate (no issue needed):
        https://translate.codeberg.org/projects/calisthenics-memory/

        If you request a new language here, I can provide an initial machine-translated draft to get things started.
        Please do not post machine-translated content on Weblate.
